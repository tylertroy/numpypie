# numpypie 
A photoionization and mass spectrum data workup library with error propogation support.

## Description

This library is an updated version of my pypie library which is made more efficient with the use of numpy and includes functions to propogate error when averaging over several scans.

See [tylertroy/pypie](https://github.com/tylertroy/pypie) for a full description of usage. 

_N.B data visualization features are not incorporated into this version and the `ms_calibrate` method is now called `mass_calibrate`.
