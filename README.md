# numpypie 
A photoionization and mass spectrum data workup library with error propogation support.

## Description

This library is an updated version of my [pypie](https://github.com/tylertroy/pypie) library which has been made more efficient with the use of numpy and includes a new `uPypie` class to support error propagation when averaging over several scans.

See [tylertroy/pypie](https://github.com/tylertroy/pypie) for a full description of usage. 

_N.B data visualization features are not incorporated into this version and the `ms_calibrate` method is now called `mass_calibrate`._
